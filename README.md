TODO:
The U and V need to be worked out, right now I set them randomly and it just looks very strange

No way to input a function, they currently have to be hardcoded

Lighting is not especially nice, especially with flat U and V values

Some implementation of GL_Lines primitive, for axis, tick marks, potentially grides, lines along functions
  Could look at animating some things with these
  
Blendshape type transformation between functions? linear interpretation in z

potential alpha channel use to look at multiple surfaces at once

Animation of balls on surfaces? (simple implementation just send them in the direction of greatest desent)

Fractals / recursive functions (Time to build model? Might not be able to be dynamic)

Some kind of GUI
