TODO:


Rotation doesn't work properly (especially left right when
  not looking from even with the horizon), THIS IS KINDA TOUGH TO DO CORRECTLY, MAYBE DON'T BOTHER

Lighting is technichally one-sided, creates wierd shadow + specular interaction
More noticable now with alpha blending

Some implementation of GL_Lines primitive, for axis, tick marks, potentially grides, lines along functions
  This is implemented as a hack using textures

Animation of balls on surfaces? (simple implementation just send them in the direction of greatest desent)

Fractals / recursive functions (Time to build model? Might not be able to be dynamic)
